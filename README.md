##Why Use TiCustomView?

The main reason these custom views were created are also the reasons why they're advantageous to use over the standard 
Titanium tab and navigation views:

1. Nested Views
  * The standard Titanium Tab Group view does not allow for nested views (eg. a tab group within a tab group). 
2. Standardized Cross-Platform Views
  * The standard Tab Group in Android has a different look and feel than it does in iOS.  These custom views allow for the same views to be used across both platforms.
3. Customized Views
  * These custom views allow for custom tab buttons, positioning, etc.
